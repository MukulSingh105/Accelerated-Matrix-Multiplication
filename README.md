<h1> Accelerated-Matrix-Multiplication <h1>
An accelerated matrix multiplier using Vivado HLS. The program can be exported as an IP block and implemented on an FPGA.
<h3> How to use <h3>
Add the files to source and test bench and run a c simulation.
You can add custom array.
<h3> Why on HLS <h3>
HLS pipelines the operation making it run parallely and way faster than on a sequential machine.
