<h1> Accelerated-Matrix-Multiplication </h1>
<p>An accelerated matrix multiplier using Vivado HLS. The program can be exported as an IP block and implemented on an FPGA.</p>
<h3> How to use </h3>
<p>Add the files to source and test bench and run a c simulation.<br>
You can add custom array.</p>
<h3> Why on HLS </h3>
<p> HLS pipelines the operation making it run parallely and way faster than on a sequential machine.</p>
